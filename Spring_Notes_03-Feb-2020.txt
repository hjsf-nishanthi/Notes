Features of Spring:
-------------------
->Spring is lightweight framework
->helps build loosely coupled system
->it is open source
->spring has a very huge community , products gets released on this
->helps to build lossely coupled system
->integrate well with other systems like hibernate
->follows best practices and have several design patterns into it 
->has numerous modules like spring core,spring mvc,spring rest

Spring core module
-------------------
core contains:
--------------
Beans
core
context
Expression Language

->spring core container is a JVM
->core container manages the life cycle of beans
->bean are nothing but POJO
->core component takes care of IOC and Dependency Injection
->spring context which is one obj which is accessed by the whole web application
->core and beans together work with IOC and DI
->context acts as a container and contains all the beans
->Interface driven development
->interface is given to view
->spring supports interface driven development
->model contains bean
->repository - connecting with db
->buisness process in service layer
->right-click->source->generate getters and setters
->service takes care of connecting to repository takes care of connecting to database
->Spring container takes care of injecting dependency using constructors or getters and setters
->spring core takes care of instantiating and injecting
->IOC container provides instance
->Bean is got from IOC container
->ApplicationContext is IOC 
->Container itself injects one bean into another bean means it is DI
->beans are singleton
->if we wanted many bean then we have to use prototype

===========
Layered architecture
======================
types are monolithic and layered.
EE are layered by nature
->repository : has connection to db
->service layer : takes care for transaction management, provides business logic
->MVC : has the UI for client (view) , controller helps to navigate between view , contains data for the view (model)
->view - JSP , model - POJO , controller - servlet

spring rest comes under repository, service layer 

IOC manages life cycle of beans 
IOC takes care of DI
XML, Java annotation and java code are the 3 configuration
inside <bean> we can use import
we can have multiple xml file
type = java.lang.String
either we can give index or give the name in bean 

Types of DI:
============
constructor based 
setter based
field based

Autowiring : wired automatically by the spring 

why we are opting for maven is :
beause traditional method has the following disadvantages
-> manually adding jars
->classpath problem (configuring)
->versioning of jar files

advantages of Maven:
automaticlly download jar files , dependencies , ensures compatible jars are downloaded,
takes care of getting the required libraries
