ORM COMES UNDER DAO
LAYERED ARCHITECTURE
Front end layer : spring mvc or angular or spring boot OR structs or react
front end framework : angular 
front end library : react
Service layer : spring rest
Repository Layer : Hibernate
DB layer : oracle db, mysql
Maven is a dependency management tool
client side which runs on browser is angular 
servlet and jsp , spring mvc are server side 
so UI is a wrap of both client side and server side
spring mvc cannnot run on browser but angular can.
pacakages : controller,dao,entity,service
entity is used inside dao
savecustomer is used to save or update
@Autowired : it goes to spring container and finds the implementation for sessionfactory , this is field-based injection
HQL - hibernate query language
in hql tables are entity
creating query which is persistent through ORM
@Transactional for transaction which is carried on service layer
In dao we ar doing both save or update
@repository tells that this acts as a bean
dependency injection in customerserviceimpl by customerdaoimpl
dao -> service -> entity -> 
@Entity
@Table(name="....")
javax.persistent.GenerationType - JPA
oracle doesn't support id column but mysql supports
sequence create sequence of numbers but will not create the number which is already given by other.
GeneratorType ..........
