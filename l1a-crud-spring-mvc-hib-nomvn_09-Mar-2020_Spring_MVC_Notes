oracle developer tools for vs code(oracle database plugin for vs code)
this plugin unstand only plsql extension not sql extension
JSTL = java server tag library
JPA = When alal the imports are in persistence (useful when changing the code to another provider)
if it is hibernate than it is specific to hibernate
hibernate is a specificaiton
entity is a bean which is persistent in a orm 
we are implementing orm using hibernate
TABLE DATA:
@Id = PRIMARY KEY
@Column(name="")
sequence name is from table sequenceName="customer_id_seq"
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator="customer_id_seq_gen") 
we have to use sequence generator to generate the values 
name of sequencegenerator and generator of generatedvalue are same
lastname is the field
Customer is model
Transactional occurs in service layer 
it happens in repo as well but main process occurs in service layer
example : service layer take the amazon pay from repo and take the remaining from credit card , if both succeed means we will get the transaction success or else it fails 
web-inf -> lib in dynamic web project 
normal java project means it is inside src
dispatcherservlet extends frameworkservlet
httpservlet request => servletwebrequest
ApplicationContext = > webapplicationcontext
spring is unobtrusive 
absolute-ordering = first it takes web.xml 
@ is only understood by webapplicationcontext and not by applicationcontext
web - inf goes into tomcat becoz spring-servlet.xml doesn't come in url , so we are giving it in tomcat
session timeout is in minutes 
localsessionfactorybean takes care of hibernate util
prefix and sufix is matched by internalresourceviewresolver
(prefix)web-inf/view/+(sentbycontroller).jsp(suffix)
